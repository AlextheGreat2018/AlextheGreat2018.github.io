    <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Alex Maynard. I am currently a student at AUM majoring in Computer Science.<br> I am expected to graduate on December 12, 2020 and hope to work in a software development job.<br> I was diagnosed with autism when I was four, which caused me to have some communication problems.<br> Over time, I was able to overcome some of those problems and become more assertive in some aspects of my life.</p>
